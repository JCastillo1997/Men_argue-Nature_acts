Streamlit App: Pollution Prediction and Comparison
This Streamlit application provides a user-friendly interface for fetching air quality data, making predictions based on machine learning models, and comparing predicted pollution levels with historical averages. The app allows users to input a city name and fetch real-time air quality data, which is then used to generate predictions for future pollution levels.

Features:
Data Fetching: Users can input a city name, and the app fetches real-time air quality data and city information.
Prediction Generation: Machine learning models are applied to the fetched data to generate predictions for future pollution levels.
Data Comparison: Predicted pollution levels are compared with historical averages to provide insights into potential changes in air quality.
Custom Prediction Models: Users can insert any prediction model in the designated folder, and if properly formatted, the app will make predictions based on that model.
Functionality:
Data Fetching and Processing: The app fetches air quality data and city information from external sources and processes it to generate predictions.
Prediction Generation: Machine learning models are applied to the fetched data to generate predictions for pollutant levels.
Data Visualization: Predicted pollution levels are visualized using animated bar charts to compare them with historical averages.
Usage:
Input City Name: Enter the name of a city in the provided text input field.
Fetch Data and Make Predictions: Click the button to fetch real-time data for the specified city, generate predictions, and compare them with historical averages.
Custom Prediction Models: Users can insert custom prediction models in the designated folder and ensure they are properly formatted to be used by the app.

## Roadmap

Phase 1: Basic Functionality
Data Fetching and Processing:

Implement data fetching functionality to retrieve air quality data for a specified city.
Process the fetched data to extract relevant information and prepare it for analysis.
Prediction Generation:

Develop machine learning models to predict future pollution levels based on historical data.
Integrate the prediction models with the app to generate forecasts for pollutant levels.
Data Comparison:

Visualize predicted pollution levels and historical averages to allow users to compare them easily.
Provide insights into potential changes in air quality based on the predictions.

Phase 2: Enhancements and Customization
Custom Prediction Models:

Allow users to insert custom prediction models into the designated folder.
Implement functionality to automatically detect and use custom models if properly formatted.
User Input Validation:

Validate user inputs to ensure the entered city name is valid and handle potential errors gracefully.
Provide feedback to users if invalid inputs are detected and guide them to correct them.
Interactive Elements:

Enhance the user interface with interactive widgets like sliders, dropdowns, and buttons.
Enable users to customize the analysis and visualization based on their preferences.

Phase 3: Performance and Optimization
Optimization:

Optimize data processing and prediction algorithms for better performance.
Reduce latency in fetching data and generating predictions to improve user experience.
Testing and Debugging:

Thoroughly test the application with various inputs and scenarios to ensure correctness and reliability.
Debug and resolve any issues or errors encountered during testing.
Scalability:

Design the application architecture to be scalable and capable of handling large volumes of data and users.
Implement caching mechanisms to store and reuse data to minimize redundant computations.

Phase 4: Advanced Features
Additional Data Sources:

Integrate additional data sources to provide more comprehensive insights into air quality.
Explore APIs or datasets for weather, traffic, or demographic information to enrich the analysis.
Real-time Updates:

Implement real-time data updates to provide users with the latest information on air quality.
Enable automatic refreshes or notifications when new data becomes available.
User Authentication and Authorization:

Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure access to sensitive features or data.
Allow registered users to save preferences, view personalized insights, or collaborate with others.

Phase 5: Documentation and Community Engagement
Documentation:

Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for installation, usage, and customization of the application.
Include examples, tutorials, and troubleshooting guides to assist users in getting started with the app.
Community Engagement:

Foster a community around the application by sharing it on relevant forums, social media, and developer communities.
Encourage users to contribute feedback, suggestions, and improvements to enhance the application further.
Continuous Improvement:

Actively monitor user feedback and analytics to identify areas for improvement and prioritize future development efforts.
Iterate on the application based on user needs and technological advancements to ensure it remains relevant and valuable.
